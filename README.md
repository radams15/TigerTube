# TigerTube

## Building a Youtube client for OSX Tiger and above.

I love retro machines, but they lack the ability to play
Youtube videos, so I built this that requires minimal
dependencies (libxml2, libcurl, wxWidgets) which are all
available in some form for old OS's.

This _should_ compile OK on Tiger, but I haven't tested it
yet.
